# Spectrometer
Code for University project of creating a simple spectrometer. 

All thats needed is a 3D printed black box with a small slit to let light in, a diffraction grating and a webcam with a USB-interface connected to a laptop running the python 3.x intepreter.

Running the spectrometer.py file results in a camera image where the user can press 'c' to select an ROI in video feed. All pixels in selected ROI will be read and organized by their wavelength (color) and plotted accordingly.
